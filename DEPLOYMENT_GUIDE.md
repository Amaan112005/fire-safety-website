To deploy this website, you can use several hosting platforms. Here are the most popular options:

1. **GitHub Pages** (Free, easy for static sites)
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Enable Pages in repository settings
   - Your site will be live at: https://AmaanSayyad.github.io/fire-safety-website

2. **Netlify** (Free tier, great for static sites)
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Automatic deployments on push
   - Custom domain support

3. **Vercel** (Free tier, fast deployments)
   - Similar to Netlify
   - Great performance
   - Easy to use

4. **Firebase Hosting** (Free tier available)
   - Google's hosting service
   - Fast global CDN
   - Good for SPAs

For quick deployment, I recommend GitHub Pages since your repo is already on GitHub.

Would you like me to help you deploy to GitHub Pages?
